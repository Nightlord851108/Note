# NP-Complete
## P problem
P(Polynomial time) problem
* There's a polynomial algorithms to solve the problem.
## NP problem
NP(Non-deterministic Polynomial time) problem
* There's no polynomial time solution, only exponential time solution, but we can examine the answer with a polynomial time algorithm.
* Since a P problem can also be solve with an exponential algorithm, P problem is a sub set of NP problem.
* Every NP problem can convert to another NP problem with a polynomial time algorithm.
## NP-Complete problem
* The hardest problems in NP problem.
* Any special case in NP-Complete covered all NP problems, that is if we can solve NP-Complete problem, we can solve NP problems.
* All NP-Complete problems are equivalently hard.
* All NP-Complete problems can convert to another NP-Complete with a polynomial time algorithm.
* Complete means: A subset that can express the whole set
## NP-hard problem
* A problem convert from an NP problem with a polynomial time algorithm.
* An NP-hard problem should be at least as hard as NP problem.
* An NP-hard problem could be either: **NP-Complete problem**(belongs to NP problem), or a problem harder than NP problem
