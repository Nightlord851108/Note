Graph is a model to keep the relation between data.

* **Vertex**: Every data node is a **vertex**, and the set of all vertexes is called **V** or **V(G)**

* **Edge**: Every line/arrow between a pair of vertext is called **edge**, marked as (Vi, Vj). the set of all edges is called E or E(G).

Graph is defined as the set consist of V and E, marked as G(V, E).


* Directed graph: The direction of edge represents the relation between vertexes. If it's unidirectional relation between vertex A and B, that means there's directionality relation between vertex A and B.

* Undirected graph: The direction of edge represents the relation between vertexes. If it's two-way  relation between vertex A and B, that means there's directionality relation between vertex A and B.
